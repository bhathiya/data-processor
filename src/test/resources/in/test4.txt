Simple File Parser
This technical assessment involves designing and building the following JAVA application:

A console application takes a directory path as argument.
The application will then monitor the folder for existing files, as well new files, with the supported file extensions (e.g. txt, pdf, doc...).
For each supported file, the application needs to process the file and print statistics on the console (e.g. number of special characters, number of words...).
After that, each processed file should be moved to a "processed" sub-folder inside the directory  that was passed as argument.
Even though this is a simpler exercise treat it like a production situation and write the code that you would expect to deliver for a live system
