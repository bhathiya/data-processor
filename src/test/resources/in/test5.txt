Process
Recruiting will schedule a 1-hour call with a HICX Engineer and Candidate to discuss the Assessment exercise.
The candidate and Engineer will discuss the exercise at and they have the opportunity to ask as many questions as they need.
The candidate will then have 30mins to complete UML Class Design
The candidate will then re-join call after 30mins and discuss their design with Engineer.
The HICX Engineer will then send candidate exercise via email and they then have 24 hours to complete solution and send it back to HICX with detailed explanation.
HICX will then review the solution within next 48 hours
Feel free to ask any questions before starting the design.
Design
Sketch a UML class diagram for Design. You can use any tool for the sketch and just provide a screenshot. (e.g. https://www.draw.io/)
Your design should include the main classes interfaces needed to meet the requirement.
Your design should cater for supporting multiple file types (e.g. txt, pdf) as well as adding more type as needed in the future.
Your design should cater for adding more statistics or processing elements as needed in the future. (e.g. number of white spaces)
You must include a detailed design breakdown explaining your primary idea, your thought process and any other information factored in to your design
Instructions
Once completed and within the allocated time you must send us the the following items

Class Diagram Design (UML) - Downloaded image file (eg: pdf, jpg) or a accessible link to design. The class diagram is mandatory, however feel free to add any additional designs that you feel are relevant. Recommendations: Use Draw.IO or a similar free tool.
Implementation in packaged zip file (With Maven project recommended not mandatory) or a link to a github repository.
A READ.ME file with detailed explanation of the of the different classes that your implementation has, their purpose/responsibility and how they interact (how your application works in a nutshell).
Please note: If you use any plugins, frameworks ensure that you include detailed instructions for our Engineers to install, build, test and run your solution.
